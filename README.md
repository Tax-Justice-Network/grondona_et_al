The repository entails code and data to assess countries' vulnerability to illicit financial flows (IFFs) through different macroeconomic channels. This approach is summarized in the paper and explained in greater detail in: Cobham, A., Garcia-Bernardo, J., Harari, M., L√©pissier, A., Lima, S., Meinzer, M., Montoya Fern√°ndez, L., & Moreno, L. (2021). Vulnerability and exposure to illicit financial flows risk in Latin America. Tax Justice Network, available here: https://www.taxjustice.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Vulnerability-and-exposure-to-illicit-financial-flows-risk-in-Latin-America-Tax-Justice-Network-Jan-2021.pdf.

The assessment combines country-level data on countries' financial secrecy with data on bilateral economic stocks and flows, namely imports and exports, inward and outward foreign portfolio investment, and inward and outward foreign direct investment (FDI). It estimates the following concepts:
- Vulnerability of country i to channel k: Degree to which a country is susceptible to IFFs within each specific channel. The vulnerability of country i in channel k is quantified by the weighted average secrecy score of all partner jurisdictions ùëó‚ààùêΩ with whom country i has had economic relationships in channel k. The weights are given by the size of the economic relationship, i.e. the value X_k of the stock or flow in channel k.

- Intensity of channel k in country i: Relevance of channel k for a country i's economy, defined as the transaction volume in a channel divided by the country's GDP.

- Exposure of country i towards channel k: Weighted vulnerability of a given channel against its economic importance. The relevance of channel k to the economy of country i is gauged by the proportion of the stock or flow from channel k in relation to the GDP of country i (i.e. its intensity).

- Contribution of partner country j to vulnerability of country i in channel k: Share of country i's vulnerability in channel k that partner country j is responsible for.
